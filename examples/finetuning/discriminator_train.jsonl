Further, 32 percent of the respondents said that their businesses would only work on new services and\/or products with organizations with which they already had a long-standing relationship.

{"prompt":"While liquidity and financial risk management remain the top two chief financial officer (CFO) mandates for treasurers, acting as a strategic partner and advisor to the business is becoming more critical than ever. Treasury is demonstrating its value as a core leadership function by supporting mergers and acquisitions, as well as organic growth activities.\n\nFurther evidence of the shift away from the traditional operational model is the requirement to become a profit center. Though this shift is still deemed as not important to more than half of respondents, it has almost doubled from 15 percent in 2017.\n\nThe global corporate treasury survey reveals that many treasurers are comfortable deploying TMS technology across companies ranging drastically in scale. But this is still not yet the case for the newest available technologies, such as robotic process automation (RPA), artificial intelligence (AI), visualization, big data, and blockchain. This is in contrast to the wider finance function in many companies, where the adoption of these new\u00a0treasury solutions\u00a0and technologies is happening at an ever-increasing pace.\n\nFrom a Deloitte perspective, we believe that the treasury profession is only at the early stage of this evolution, which could disrupt the way we consider companies using technology in the future. These new technologies are starting to become available within finance organizations. It\u2019s therefore helpful to understand existing areas where these technologies are being implemented.\n\nPractical use cases of new technologies are available in all regions. However, a lack of insight into specific treasury solutions combined with unknown costs is cited as the most common challenges for applying these in the treasury function.\nQuestion: What percentage of survey respondents agreed that business ecosystems enabled their organization to innovate beyond its individual capabilities?\n Related:","completion":" no"}

{"prompt":"A Czech company had been on the market for almost 20 years when its stable business partner offered it an advantageous purchase of goods that were currently in high demand. All it took was a quick calculation and it was decided. If the deal works out, it will not be necessary to lay off employees. The deal went well, but the company does not exist anymore. The tax authority came and accused it of being involved in VAT fraud. One of the subcontractors that the company was never in contact with apparently failed to pay VAT. The company\u2019s entitlement to deduction was retrospectively revoked and additional tax was assessed in an amount that greatly exceeded the company\u2019s financial ability. Orders of seizures and the subsequent execution completed the destruction. A company that has always properly fulfilled its obligations suffered the consequences of dealing with fraudsters.

{"prompt":"A Czech company had been on the market for almost 20 years when its stable business partner offered it an advantageous purchase of goods that were currently in high demand. All it took was a quick calculation and it was decided. If the deal works out, it will not be necessary to lay off employees. The deal went well, but the company does not exist anymore. The tax authority came and accused it of being involved in VAT fraud. One of the subcontractors that the company was never in contact with apparently failed to pay VAT. The company\u2019s entitlement to deduction was retrospectively revoked and additional tax was assessed in an amount that greatly exceeded the company\u2019s financial ability. Orders of seizures and the subsequent execution completed the destruction. A company that has always properly fulfilled its obligations suffered the consequences of dealing with fraudsters.

{"prompt":"A Czech company had been on the market for almost 20 years when its stable business partner offered it an advantageous purchase of goods that were currently in high demand. All it took was a quick calculation and it was decided. If the deal works out, it will not be necessary to lay off employees. The deal went well, but the company does not exist anymore. The tax authority came and accused it of being involved in VAT fraud. One of the subcontractors that the company was never in contact with apparently failed to pay VAT. The company\u2019s entitlement to deduction was retrospectively revoked and additional tax was assessed in an amount that greatly exceeded the company\u2019s financial ability. Orders of seizures and the subsequent execution completed the destruction. A company that has always properly fulfilled its obligations suffered the consequences of dealing with fraudsters. It did not have demonstrably set-up sufficient control measures that could have allowed it to discover potential fraud.

{"prompt":"Innovation is one area in which many family business leaders\u2019 attitudes seem particularly out of step with their actions. A large majority (89 percent) of survey respondents agreed that business ecosystems enabled their organization to innovate beyond its individual capabilities. Yet when asked about their actual participation in innovation projects, more than half (53 percent) said that they rarely or never partnered with other organizations during the past three years, pointing to a lingering reluctance among at least some family-owned businesses to engage with external parties. Further, 32 percent of the respondents said that their businesses would only work on new services and\/or products with organizations with which they already had a long-standing relationship. This is consistent with many family businesses\u2019 traditional emphasis on operating within stable, closely knit networks of collaborators\u2014a model that is at odds with the more fluid and varied modes of interaction that characterize today\u2019s business ecosystems.\nQuestion: 1.
