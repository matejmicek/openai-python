A large majority (89 percent) of survey respondents agreed that business ecosystems enabled their organization to innovate beyond its individual capabilities. Yet when asked about their actual participation in innovation projects, more than half (53 percent) said that they rarely or never partnered with other organizations during the past three years, pointing to a lingering reluctance among at least some family-owned businesses to engage with external parties. Further, 32 percent of the respondents said that their businesses would only work on new services and\/or products with organizations with which they already had a long-standing relationship.

{"text":"While liquidity and financial risk management remain the top two chief financial officer (CFO) mandates for treasurers, acting as a strategic partner and advisor to the business is becoming more critical than ever. Treasury is demonstrating its value as a core leadership function by supporting mergers and acquisitions, as well as organic growth activities.\n\nFurther evidence of the shift away from the traditional operational model is the requirement to become a profit center. Though this shift is still deemed as not important to more than half of respondents, it has almost doubled from 15 percent in 2017.\n\nThe global corporate treasury survey reveals that many treasurers are comfortable deploying TMS technology across companies ranging drastically in scale. But this is still not yet the case for the newest available technologies, such as robotic process automation (RPA), artificial intelligence (AI), visualization, big data, and blockchain. This is in contrast to the wider finance function in many companies, where the adoption of these new\u00a0treasury solutions\u00a0and technologies is happening at an ever-increasing pace.\n\nFrom a Deloitte perspective, we believe that the treasury profession is only at the early stage of this evolution, which could disrupt the way we consider companies using technology in the future. These new technologies are starting to become available within finance organizations. It\u2019s therefore helpful to understand existing areas where these technologies are being implemented.\n\nPractical use cases of new technologies are available in all regions. However, a lack of insight into specific treasury solutions combined with unknown costs is cited as the most common challenges for applying these in the treasury function.","metadata":1758}
